0. Write a patch
1. Change versions to 2.3.1.x

(See commit https://github.com/opentable/kafka/pull/1/commits/cc4e523bd8f1b880bb123cd06f9d15c06603cfb5)

2. build jars from root

./gradlew clean jar 
./gradlew srcJar

3. Copy the jars from build/libs directory to /pom directory
4. Change pom appropriately - namely version and filename

5. Deploy to artifactory internal-local. 

You'll specify the location under internal-local as

org/apache/kafka/kafka-clients/(version)

You'll want to deploy - the pom, the main jar, the test jar, and the source jar.
